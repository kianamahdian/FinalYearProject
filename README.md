# 📘 Final Year Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the code and resources for my final year thesis on **Collective Social Choice in Decision Making**. The project explores different aggregation functions and voting methods to analyze group decision-making processes.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
```
├── Dataset generating codes/   # Scripts for generating datasets  
├── References/                 # Research papers and related materials  
├── aggregation functions/       # Implementation of various voting rules  
├── datasets/                    # Sample datasets for testing  
├── graph codes/                 # Visualization scripts for results

└── README.md                    # Project documentation (this file)  
```  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Primary language)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For experimentation and analysis)  

## 📊 Features  
- Implementation of multiple **social choice functions** (Borda, Kemeny, Simpson, etc.)  
- Dataset generation for testing voting outcomes  
- Graph visualization of decision-making processes  

## 🚀 Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kianamahdian/FinalYearProject.git
   cd FinalYearProject
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
   (Make sure a `requirements.txt` file exists. If not, I can generate one for you.)  

3. Run Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  

## 📝 Usage  
- **Running aggregation functions**:  
  Navigate to the `aggregation functions/` folder and execute the scripts for different voting methods.  

- **Generating datasets**:  
  Use the scripts in `Dataset generating codes/` to create synthetic datasets for analysis.  

- **Visualizing results**:  
  The `graph codes/` folder contains scripts to generate decision-making visualizations.  

## 🎯 Goals of the Project  
- To compare different voting methods in collective decision-making scenarios
